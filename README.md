👥 Team Roles

Backend Developer

Designs and builds the core engine of the application — creating API endpoints, implementing business logic, and setting up database schemas. In this project, they ensure smooth communication between the front end and the database, basically making the magic happen behind the curtain.

Database Administrator (DBA)

Architects the heart of the data layer. They design and optimize the database, set up indexing for faster queries, and make sure the data structure can scale. In this project, they ensure data is not just stored, but stored smartly — fast, reliable, and secure.

DevOps Engineer

Bridges the gap between development and operations. They automate deployments, set up CI/CD pipelines, monitor system health, and handle scaling. In this project, they make sure the backend doesn’t just work on a laptop — it works at scale, in production, under real pressure.

QA Engineer

The shield against disaster. They design and run rigorous tests to catch bugs before users ever see them. In this project, they ensure backend functionalities are reliable, secure, and meet the project's quality standards, so no surprises explode after launch.

📚 Technology Stack

🗄 Database Design

Relations Summary:

A User can own multiple Properties.

A User can make multiple Bookings.

Each Booking is for one Property.

Each Payment is linked to a Booking.

A Review belongs to a User and a Property.

🧩 Feature Breakdown

User Management

Users can register, login, and manage their profiles securely. Essential for personalizing the platform and tracking user activities.

Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. This keeps the marketplace dynamic and up-to-date.

Booking System

Allows users to book available properties, manage dates, and handle stays. Core functionality to mimic Airbnb’s main flow.

Payment Processing

Secure handling of payments related to bookings. Ensures that transactions are safe, traceable, and integrated with the booking system.

Review System

Users can leave feedback and ratings on properties they’ve stayed in. Builds trust in the platform and helps users make informed decisions.

Performance Optimization

Through database indexing and caching, the app will handle large loads and scale without breaking a sweat.

🔒 API Security Overview

Authentication

Secure login/registration with password hashing and token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).

Authorization

Only authorized users can create properties, bookings, or reviews tied to their accounts.

Rate Limiting

Prevents brute force attacks and abusive API usage by limiting the number of requests from a single user/IP.

Data Validation and Sanitization

All inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

Why It's Critical:

Protect user data from breaches.

Secure transactions to prevent financial fraud.

Maintain platform integrity by preventing abuse.

🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated. Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically deploys the latest version into staging or production without manual intervention.

Why it matters for this project:

Saves time: No more "works on my machine" syndrome.

Reduces bugs: Automated testing catches issues early.

Speeds up releases: Get features to users faster.

Tools Used:

GitHub Actions: For automating tests, builds, and deployments.

Docker: To containerize the app for consistent environments.

Optional: AWS/GCP/Azure for cloud deployment later on.
